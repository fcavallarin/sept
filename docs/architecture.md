# Architecture

SEPT separates **device trust and application authorization** from the relay used to transport events.

The current JavaScript implementation is intentionally pragmatic: protocol logic, persistence and runtime orchestration live together in `@sept/client`. The project does not currently claim a formal `proto`/`sdk` package boundary; that boundary is expected to become clearer through interoperability and future ports.

### `@sept/client`

The client currently owns:

- device key generation and local identity;
- network bootstrap and pairing;
- event encryption, signing, verification and decryption;
- directed authorization policies;
- admin/device lifecycle;
- local SQLite-backed state;
- REST synchronization;
- WebSocket connection/reconnection;
- application event registration and dispatch;
- a small namespaced application KV store.

### `@sept/core`

Cross-runtime primitives:

- canonical JSON;
- binary/base64url serialization;
- deterministic IDs;
- generic utilities;
- request helpers;
- SQL adapters;
- event bus;
- async queue.

### `@sept/crypto`

Cryptographic primitives used by client/server:

- Ed25519 signing and verification;
- X25519 key agreement;
- HKDF-SHA256 key derivation;
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption;
- SHA-256 hashing;
- secure random values.

### `@sept/server`

The server package provides the reference relay implementation:

- bootstrap registration;
- signed request authentication for established devices;
- pairing coordination;
- encrypted event acceptance and pending-recipient storage;
- relay-side event sequencing;
- ACK processing;
- WebSocket ticketing and Durable Object push delivery;
- a plugin surface for custom routes and server-side event notifications.

### Cloudflare server template

`server/templates/cloudflare` is the standalone deployment template for `@sept/server`. It wires D1, Durable Objects and R2 through Wrangler and can be scaffolded into any target directory. The generated project is an independent application that consumes `@sept/server` as a normal npm dependency.

## Trust boundaries

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph TrustedDeviceA[Trusted device A]
    KeyA[Private signing key\nPrivate encryption key]
    PolicyA[Local policies]
    EventA[Decrypted events]
  end

  subgraph RelayBoundary[Relay / infrastructure]
    Pub[Device signing public keys]
    Meta[Network/device routing metadata]
    Cipher[Encrypted event payloads\nWrapped payload keys]
    Seq[Relay-assigned sequence]
  end

  subgraph TrustedDeviceB[Trusted device B]
    KeyB[Private signing key\nPrivate encryption key]
    PolicyB[Local policies]
    EventB[Decrypted events]
  end

  TrustedDeviceA --> RelayBoundary --> TrustedDeviceB
```

The relay is intentionally **not the source of truth for application authorization**. A recipient evaluates the sender's locally stored policy after verifying/decrypting an event.

The relay is still trusted for availability, transport routing, pending-event delivery and relay-assigned ordering. It also participates in initial pairing trust bootstrap before a new device has a trusted admin key. These are distinct from content confidentiality and application authorization; see [Security](security.md).

## Event flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Sender device
  participant R as SEPT relay
  participant B as Recipient device

  A->>A: Check local policy
  A->>A: Encrypt {type,payload}
  A->>A: Wrap payload key for B
  A->>A: Sign event material
  A->>R: Signed HTTP request + encrypted event
  R->>R: Authenticate sender / verify relay signature
  R->>R: Assign sequence + create pending event
  R-->>B: Push through Durable Object (if connected)
  B->>B: Verify sender signature
  B->>B: Unwrap key + decrypt payload
  B->>B: Check local policy
  B->>B: Persist accepted event
  B->>R: ACK event id
  B->>B: Dispatch local handler
```

For accepted events, ACK occurs after local persistence and before handler execution. Policy-denied events are discarded and ACKed without being persisted.

Offline recipients obtain the same pending events through `sync()`.

## Pairing flow

Pairing is the mechanism that introduces a new device and its public keys into a network.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant N as New device
  participant A as Admin device
  participant R as Relay

  N->>N: initDevice(): create signing/encryption keys
  N-->>A: deviceData through app/QR/out-of-band channel
  A->>R: create pairing + short PIN + encrypted payloads
  A-->>N: PIN
  N->>R: redeem pairing with deviceId + PIN
  R-->>N: encrypted network/admin bootstrap data
  N->>N: decrypt and store network + admin public keys
  A->>R: poll redeemed pairings
  R-->>A: encrypted admin payload
  A->>A: store new device
  A->>A: notify other admins via sept.device.add
```

Only the admin device that initiated a pairing can retrieve/consume its admin-side completion payload. The relay stores opaque encrypted pairing payloads, but the new device necessarily relies on the relay during this initial bootstrap because it has no existing trust anchor yet.

## Persistence model

The client uses local SQLite-backed stores for:

- settings and local private-key material (with a configurable secret-key provider where used);
- network identity;
- device public keys/roles/revocation state;
- directed graph edges and policies;
- incoming/outgoing events and recipients;
- application KV state.

This local state is what lets authorization remain available without asking the relay for permission on every application event.

The relay uses D1 as an operational index for networks, devices, pending events, pairings and event sequence state. A pending event is removed for a device when that device ACKs it; the encrypted event row can be removed once no pending recipients remain.

## Runtime boundaries vs protocol boundaries

The repository currently favors working cross-runtime code over a prematurely formalized package taxonomy. For example, SQLite persistence is part of the current client implementation even though a future Go implementation may choose a simpler storage surface.

A useful rule when interpreting the code is:

- **wire/protocol behavior:** key material, canonicalization, signing/encryption, pairing semantics, event verification, system events and authorization semantics;
- **runtime/SDK behavior:** SQLite query helpers, event filtering ergonomics, namespaced KV storage, REST/WebSocket lifecycle and platform adapters;
- **application behavior:** domain-specific messages, device actions, agent/tool requests, or any other event vocabulary defined by the host application.

The exact `protocol` vs `SDK` package split is intentionally not frozen yet.
